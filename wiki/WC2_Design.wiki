#summary Phase 2 Design

Link: http://world-crisis.appspot.com/

By the end of this project, weâ€™ll have a Google App Engine application that tracks world crises, similar to how IMdB tracks movies and movie stars.

IMDB has two major kinds of pages: movies/shows and people. Movies/shows link to people and people link back to movies/shows.

WC will have three major kinds of pages: crises, organizations, and people, and gain each will link to the others.

For the second phase of this project, we were required to: 
    * redesign the GAE datastore models to represent the data
    * redesign the import/export facility from the XML into GAE and back
    * import/export data on the four crises with the new XML and post to the public repository
    * create a UML diagram of either the XML design or the GAE datastore design
    * 10 pts of extra credit for the doing the other UML design with an explanation of the differences
    * create a GUI to present and navigate the data
    * write an initial technical report

    * Download- http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/download/2.x/BeautifulSoup.2.1.1.py 

Beautiful Soup is a Python HTML/XML parser designed for quick turnaround projects like screen-scraping. We use it in WC2.py to facilitate the import/export of XML data. For convenience, the BeautifulSoup.py is included in the turnin zip file.
